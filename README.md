## Tests ⚙️

The app was tested with MSTestv2.
The MSTest framework occupies a distinct position in this ecosystem, and is used by many to write pure unit tests as well as to write UI/functional/load tests. However, over the years, we ended up creating multiple flavours of MSTest as we introduced support for new app-platforms – to the point where there are subtle differences in the feature set supported for desktop apps, Store apps, and for UWP apps.
